Examples Section:
  - [x] This article does not need an example. (Check this box only in rare cases. Most articles need examples.)
  
Notes:
  The track object contains the collection of [[apis/audio-video/TextTrackCue|TextTrackCues]] (times and text) that are contained in the file that the '''track''' element represents.

  ====WEBVTT====
  '''TextTrackCues''' within a '''TextTrack''' can be defined within a '''[http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#dfnReturnLink-1 WebVTT]''' file which is defined as an 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8) format text files that look like the following.
   <code>WEBVTT
 
   00:00:01.878 --&gt; 00:00:05.334
   Good day everyone, my name is John Smith
   
   00:00:08.608 --&gt; 00:00:15.296

   </code>
  The file starts with the tag "WEBVTT" as the first line, followed by a line feed. The timing cues are in the format "HH:MM:SS.sss". The start and end time cues are separated by a space, two hyphens and a greater-than sign ( --&gt; ), and another space. The timing cues are on a line by themselves followed by a line feed. Immediately following the cue is the caption text. Text captions can be one or more lines. The only restriction is that there must be no blank lines between lines of text. The MIME type is "text/vtt".
