==Before you start==

In this section, you will be writing a lot of code, and testing it out in web browsers. Before you start, you should at least have the following installed:

* The newest browsers you are able to install. — You do not need all of them in the same time, a recent one will do!
** All Platforms
***[https://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome]
***[http://www.mozilla.org/firefox Mozilla Firefox]
***[http://www.opera.com Opera]
** Windows
***[http://microsoft.com/ie Microsoft Internet Explorer]
** Mac OS
***[http://www.apple.com/safari/ Apple Safari].

* ''Optional'', a bleeding edge version of the browser — useful if you want to test very recent techniques
** [http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html Google Chrome Canary]
** [http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/#aurora Mozilla Firefox Aurora]
** [http://www.opera.com/computer/next Opera Next]
** A [https://modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads modern.ie VM] with a pre-release version of Microsoft Internet Explorer

* A text editor, there are plenty of free and open source for you to choose from. — try to learn by avoiding auto-completion and type everything, you will feel the benefits later!
** All Platforms
<!--
DO NOT:
Add Sublime Text to this list. It is *NOT* free.
The point of the editors listed are to be free and
simple to use editors that someone with no prior
experience can pick up and start writing with.

Also, please do not add terminal programs like vim
and emacs to this list. Yes they are great, but not
entry level editors.

Thank you for your co operation.
